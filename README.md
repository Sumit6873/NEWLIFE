# NEWLIFE
This project is to measure the level of depression and how to overcome it using technology and dharma

# OVERVIEW
NewLife is a website which helps people that are dealing with depression and anxiety. Here they can check the level of their stress and can take preventive measures for the same, as mentioned in our website. People can also have a feeling of being in nature using the AR model that we've integrated, thanks to echoAR

# INSPIRATION
A lot of people experience anxiety and stress on a daily basis, well actually 300 million people worldwide. So that's what inspired us to make something that can help the community.

# STATUS
the site is live at https://sumit6873.github.io/NEWLIFE/

# CHALLENGES WE FACED
It was a bit difficult to integrate all the webpages and API together, but we figured it out anyways.

# ACCOMPLISHMENTS WE'RE PROUD OF
We're proud and happy for the fact that we made something really nice and workable in a very short period of time. It was a really productive weekend for all of us!!

# WHAT'S NEXT FOR NEWLIFE?
We'll be integrating better user experience and more features in the near future !!
